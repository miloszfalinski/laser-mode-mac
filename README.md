# Laser Mode on your Mac
Make your Mac distraction-free with a simple keystroke.


## What? 
Laser Mode is a simple-as-hell Mac App made in Automator that does the following when you run it:
* Hides your Dock
* Hides your Menu Bar
* Sets Do Not Disturb mode to disable all notifications
* Hides Sticky Notes app, if it's running
* Hides Desktop icons (optional)
* Turns off Wi-Fi (optional)

It comes in a two flavours tailored to the level of focus you want to achieve:
* **Laser Mode**  -  my default, with everything mentioned above
* **Focus Mode**  -  everything in Laser, but does not toggle Desktop icons or WiFi. Good for working with files or doing research.
